# Pre-compiled-OpenWrt-Firmware
Pre-compiled OpenWrt firmware

The supported devices we cover are the Linksys WRT1900ACSv2 and Linksys EA6350v3. There are two flavours of the firmware we upload:-

* Vanilla - exactly the same as downloading from OpenWrt download site but with the exception of patches have been applied to address issues

* Full - full packaged firmware containing most of the popular utilities and LuCI apps

The firmware can be found at our releases page > https://github.com/TheSurgeNetwork/Pre-compiled-OpenWrt-Firmware/releases

**PLEASE NOTE THIS ROUTER HAS TWO FLASH PARTITIONS. PLEASE SWITCH OVER TO THE STOCK/LINKSYS FIRMWARE ON THE OTHER PARTITION BEFORE FLASHING THIS OPENWRT FIRMWARE.**

**REMEMBER IN ANY CASE OF FLASHING STOCK OR OPENWRT FIRMWARE, WHICHEVER PARTITION YOU ARE CURRENTLY THE NEXT FLASH WILL SWAP OVER TO THE OTHER PARTITION.**

Additionally if you wish to compile your own firmware I have included full instructions to which these can be found in the `Compile Your Own Firmware.md` file.

Happy flashing!
